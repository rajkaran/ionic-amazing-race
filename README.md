# Ionic Amazing Race: Revolutionizing Event Management

**Ionic Amazing Race** was an innovative electronic solution designed to modernize a popular annual event at Woodstock Hospital. Unfortunately, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the application was never fully developed or launched. Despite this setback, the project had immense potential and a well-structured setup that could have transformed how events like these are managed.

The concept was simple yet groundbreaking: event participants would log in via QR codes received in their invitation. As they visited each stall, they would scan a QR code and answer a quiz related to that stall. Based on the number of correct answers, participants would earn electronic ballots. At the end of the event, these ballots would be placed into electronic buckets, and a random draw would determine the prize winners at the conclusion of the 4-day event.

This approach not only streamlined the event experience but also brought multiple benefits to the hospital:

## Features

- **QR Code Login**: Participants log in using a QR code, eliminating the need to remember credentials.
- **Staff Badge Auto Login**: In place of personal QR codes, hospital staff could use their badges for seamless auto-login.
- **No Personal Devices Required**: The app ran on hospital-provided tablets, ensuring participants didn't need to install anything on their personal phones.
- **Eco-friendly**: By going paperless, the app reduced waste and made the event more sustainable.
- **Time and Cost Savings**: The app replaced manual quiz checks, saving significant staff hours and reducing operational costs for the hospital.
- **Prevention of Double-Dipping**: By automating the process, the app ensured no participant could cheat by answering the same quiz multiple times.
- **Transparency in Draws**: With no human involvement in the process, the app ensured fair and transparent prize draws, eliminating any possibility of foul play.

**Built in 2019**, this app had the potential to reshape the way hospital events are managed, making them more efficient, engaging, and eco-friendly. It stands as a testament to how technology can elevate even the simplest of events, bringing greater transparency, savings, and a more enjoyable experience for all involved.
